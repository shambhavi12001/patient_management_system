# patient_management_system
This project involves the development of an application for viewing and managing patient data.
The app is designed to help doctors to see the medical history of their patients. 
Doctors can also continually upgrade the system by entering the latest medical data of their patients. 
It will have a front-end interface that will include login pages and sign-up pages for doctors, patients and admin. 
The back end will manage the data and store it in a collection of various classes and array lists. 
The program will have classes like doctor, patient, admin, nurse, department, hospital, patient chart, billing information and schedule.
